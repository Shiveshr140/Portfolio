                        The project combines maze generation algorithms, physics simulations, and user input to create an engaging 
                        and challenging gaming experience, that showcases my passion for game development and proficiency in web technologies.                   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The game dynamically generates random mazes using a recursive backtracking algorithm, providing a unique and 
                        challenging layout for each playthrough. The project is designed to be responsive, ensuring an optimal 
                        gaming experience on both desktop and mobile devices. Touch controls are implemented for mobile users, 
                        offering a seamless and intuitive interaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Leveraging the Matter.js physics engine, the game features realistic ball movement and collisions 
                        with maze walls. The physics simulation enhances the overall gaming experience and adds an element 
                        of realism.

                    <p>
                        The goal of the game is to navigate the ball through the maze and reach the green goal area. 
                        Upon successful completion, the player is notified of their victory.
